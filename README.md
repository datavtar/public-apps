# Datavtar AI Public Applications

This repository serves as a public storage space for applications generated by BuildIt, a platform by Datavtar AI, for free plan users. These applications showcase the capabilities of our AI technology and are openly accessible to everyone.

## About Datavtar AI

Datavtar AI is an advanced artificial intelligence company specializing in innovative solutions through cutting-edge machine learning techniques. With our platform, BuildIt, we aim to make the power of information technology and software accessible to everyone, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains directories for each application generated by free plan users on the BuildIt platform. Each directory follows the naming convention `project_name_with_id`, where `project_name` is the generated application’s name and `id` is a four-character unique identifier (e.g., `myapp_1a2b`).

New applications are added as free plan users create them, so check back for updates!

## Accessing the Applications

Applications generated by BuildIt are hosted and fully accessible online at `https://buildit.datavtar.com/project_name_with_id`. For example, an application named `myapp_1a2b` can be found at `https://buildit.datavtar.com/myapp_1a2b`. You can also run these applications locally by following the instructions below.

## Running the Applications Locally

Each application’s directory (e.g., `myapp_1a2b`) includes a `README.md` file with specific instructions tailored to that project. To run an application locally, follow these general steps:
